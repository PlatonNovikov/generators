# generators
A small game made in 10-15 hours. You can even play it, although I have no idea why. There is procedural world generation, which, however, has not yet been used anywhere.

***
At the beginning of the game, you must select a starting city. Every city has residents who are able to work. Each of them can work up to 8 hours a day, 28 days a week (224 hours in total).
